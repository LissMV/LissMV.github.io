      This project was developed as a team during the first year of the ¡Supérate! scholarship. which consisted of developing a solution to a problem.
      This project was worked on using Office 365 tools, especially Power Apps and Microsoft Lists, among others. The goal was to demonstrate the lessons
      we had learned throughout the year. It was the first project focused on technology and the creation of an idea. It was like learning a small part
      of EXPO and an experience prior to that.</h1>
