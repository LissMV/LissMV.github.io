      This was a very important project that we worked on in teams for more than six months. It consists of
      demonstrating what we have learned in ¡Supérate! Through an innovative project that solves a real problem,
      learning to work in teams and using different technological tools such as programming languages and editing
      programs (Figma, Illustrator, JavaScript, HTML, Visual Studio Code, Laravel, GitHub and PHP), among others.

      The project consists of creating an e-commerce site for biodegradable products provided by Salvadoran
      entrepreneurs.
      The goal is to create a site where customers can easily access these products, with confidence in the sellers,
      prices, and accessible information. </h1>

      was the leader of this project. At first it was very difficult, because it was the first time I had worked as the
      leader of such a large project, but it was also very rewarding to see how we managed to make progress. Thanks to
      this project, I began to discover my passion, which is programming. Since I started developing the website, it has
      been something I have enjoyed doing. In addition to being the leader, I was also a programmer. Everyone had an
      assigned role, whether it was branding, design, or creating the final presentation pitch.</h1>

      The team was form of eight people. While we were working on the project, we divided the roles into English, programming
      (frontend and backend), UX/UI, and branding, but when it came the EXPO day (the achievements fair) three roles were created:
      those who would present the project for four minutes, networking, and, in my case, questions and answers, which consisted of
      answering doubts about the project.</p>
