    I am a student motivated by finding ways to improve my skills and willing to work hard to achieve my goals and always learn something new to
    continue my education and improve my knowledge. I am a dreamer. I like to create, innovate, and participate in activities such as extracurricular
    activities and volunteering that allow me to develop as a leader and future professional.</h1>

    To tell you a little about my education, I completed grades one through nine at Centro Escolar "José María Cáceres". I spent nine years there learning
    many things and having incredible experiences. I have always enjoyed participating in grade-level leadership roles, so I was president more than once,
    and that has helped me develop my leadership skills. I am currently finishing my high school education at Complejo Educativo "Walter A. Soundy" in Santa
    Tecla, where I have had the opportunity to be president of the student government.</h1>
